Sarah Sbert - Developer Log

Progress made through 2/17/2020
- We met with Paras and discussed the scope of the project and main features to be implemented.
  Such features included a quiz mode and learning mode, a database to store a collection of retina images for each eye, and a menu for the 
  user to select which mode they would like to use.
- We met with Alex Wyllie and discussed the state of the current project and the difficulties and issues the previous team expereinced
  with android studio and getting the functionality of application to work properly.
- We had several team meetings discussing the application and the team assignments due in class.
  In one of these team meetings we discussed and completed the user story assignment.
  In another one of the meetings, we discussed and distributed the work for the requirements documentation.
  We also came to the conclusion that using Unity would be a more efficient way to implement this project.
- More detailed information is in the team's Developer Notes in the Meetings folder where we recorded notes for each of the 
  meetings that were briefly discussed above.
