2/14/20 Meeting with Alex Wyllie from the previous group

What was the goal of the project?
What features have you implemented?
What difficulties did you encounter while working with the AR/VR versions?
What do you think of us switching to a different platform (Unity)?

Purpose of meeting - Meeting with prev group member, try to get cardboard stuff to work

They did a refactor, and it broke stuff, but on 2/12 Alex pushed code to undo refactor. 
3 apps in the repo
	Android
	iOS
	AR - iOS - dont bother without xCode and mac.

To get stuff working-
	Make sure stuff is cloned properly and up to date.
	Same build process as hello project app
	Under gradle scripts, sdk -> Tasks -> build -> assemble. Should take 5ish mins.
	Afterwards, can be run on emulator.
	Install stuff for cardboard demo app. And nothing else should be required.

	In build, settings, make sure to have offline work enabled.

Code for android app is in C++
hello_cardboard.cc is where most of the code is
	Where we call the shape and image and make it render?

Unity was the original workflow with cardboard, but it deprecated
Hardest part with the project was fighting android studio, and getting the cardboard deprecated.
iOS app was made quickly, easily. Android was tough
Not a coding heavy project, more of a working through a non-compliant library/ api project.

Create a new launching point for the app (in java). Traditional app development

Was there more than just a picture of the eye? No
170 by 200 degree pictures?
Demo was the picture on a circle, instead of on the inside of a semi-sphere

Original plan was to make it widely available. Which is why google cardboard route was taken
